#Idea

the idea is to find out wether the victim uses a windows, linus or mac based OS, gather information about the victim, and upload it to a USB or a webserver. The victim must have python installed tho.

#Usage
Right now it just works in terminal, but I'm working on outputting to a online database/a local .txt file (on a usb for example). To use it right now, just run get_info.py
