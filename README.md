#Idea

the idea is to find out wether the victim uses a windows, linus or mac based OS, gather information about the victim, and upload it to a USB or a webserver. The victim must have python installed tho.

information you will be getting:
   ~PC name
   ~OS
   ~OS version
   ~username
   ~possibly some wifi passwords
   ~when it's windows, a copy of the SAM hash

#Usage
Right now it just works in terminal, but I'm working on outputting to a online database/a local .txt file (on a usb for example). To use it right now, just run get_info.py
